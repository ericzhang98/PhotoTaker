Photo Taker

How to build:
Open up the program in XCode 8 and run the program with an actual iPhone
attached, since you can't test the photo taking functionality on the simulator.

Further Considerations
I've read up on and am still working on the secure data storage. The AVFoundation stuff was new to
me and I spent a lot of time implementing it. I'll have the keychain stuff done by tomorrow.
